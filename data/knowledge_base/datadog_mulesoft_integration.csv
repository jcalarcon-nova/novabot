The error states 'sudo: unknown user dd-agent' and 'sudo: error initializing audit plugin sudoers_audit'.

Resolution: 1. For the API_KEY and CUSTOMER_KEY:
     - These are provided when you purchase the product. If you don't have them, contact the Datadog support team or check your purchase confirmation email.
     - The API_KEY is your Datadog API key, which you can find in your Datadog account settings.
     - The CUSTOMER_KEY is specific to the MuleSoft integration and should have been provided upon purchase.

2. For the installation error:
     - The error suggests that the 'dd-agent' user doesn't exist on your MacBook. This is expected as the Datadog Agent installation process differs on macOS compared to Linux systems.
     - On macOS, you should run the command without 'sudo -u dd-agent'. Instead, use:
       `datadog-agent integration install --third-party datadog-mulesoft-anypoint==1.3.0`
     - If you haven't installed the Datadog Agent yet, make sure to do so first using the official Datadog documentation for macOS installation.
     - After installation, you may need to start the agent using:
       `launchctl start com.datadoghq.agent`

"Calculating Total vCores in Datadog Dashboard - The user has successfully created a table showing the number of active and inactive workers, their size, and the application name. However, they are unable to calculate the total vCores per application, which should be the product of the number of workers and the workers_weight. The issue arises because workers_weight is not a metric, preventing its use in a formula field within the dashboard.","Problem: The user has successfully created a table showing the number of active and inactive workers, their size, and the application name. However, they are unable to calculate the total vCores per application, which should be the product of the number of workers and the workers_weight. The issue arises because workers_weight is not a metric, preventing its use in a formula field within the dashboard.

Resolution: To calculate the total vCores per application, you can try the following approaches:

1. Use a custom metric: Create a custom metric that combines the number of workers and the workers_weight. This can be done using Datadog's custom metrics feature or by modifying the data collection process to include this calculation.

2. Utilize Datadog's formula feature: If workers_weight is available as a tag or attribute, you might be able to use Datadog's formula feature to perform the calculation. This would involve using functions like `sum by` or `as_count()` along with multiplication.

3. Implement a query-time calculation: If the workers_weight is stored as metadata or in a separate data source, you could potentially use a query-time calculation to combine it with the worker count. This might involve using Datadog's query language to join or correlate the data.

4. Use a backend service: If the above options are not feasible within Datadog, consider creating a small backend service that performs this calculation and exposes it as a metric that Datadog can then collect and display.

5. Leverage Datadog's API: Write a script that uses Datadog's API to fetch the required data, perform the calculation, and then post the result back as a custom metric.

After implementing one of these solutions, you should be able to display the total vCores per application in your dashboard and then sum these values to get the total vCore usage across all applications.",datadog-mulesoft,"datadog,troubleshooting,mulesoft",medium

MuleSoft Integration with Datadog - Pricing and Licensing - Understanding the pricing structure and licensing requirements for integrating MuleSoft with Datadog.,"Problem: Understanding the pricing structure and licensing requirements for integrating MuleSoft with Datadog.

Resolution: DMI Pricing Model:
DMI licensing based on total MuleSoft vCores (production and sandbox) per customer's license agreement with MuleSoft.

vCore Counting:
Each vCore counts as one unit for pricing regardless of:
- Number of Mule applications deployed on that vCore
- Application distribution across vCores
- Shared vs dedicated vCore usage

Pricing Calculation:
- Production vCores: Included in pricing calculation
- Sandbox vCores: Included in pricing calculation
- Total vCore count determines licensing cost
- Application count does not affect pricing

MuleSoft License Alignment:
DMI pricing aligns with MuleSoft's licensing model where vCores are the unit of measurement, not individual applications or application instances.

vCore Verification:
Customer should confirm:
1. Total Production vCores in MuleSoft license
2. Total Sandbox vCores in MuleSoft license  
3. Current vCore allocation across environments

Pricing Information:
For specific pricing details and vCore-based cost calculations, refer to Datadog Marketplace where DMI licensing is purchased and managed.

"Visualizing Mule Layers in Datadog APM Dependency Map - The customer is expecting to see the links between different Mule layers (Experience Layer, Process Layer, System Layer) in the Datadog APM Dependency Map. However, the current view only shows the current API without displaying the relationships between these layers.","Problem: The customer is expecting to see the links between different Mule layers (Experience Layer, Process Layer, System Layer) in the Datadog APM Dependency Map. However, the current view only shows the current API without displaying the relationships between these layers.

Resolution: The Datadog APM Dependency Map typically shows service-to-service dependencies based on the traced requests between services. To visualize Mule layers in the Dependency Map:

1. Ensure proper instrumentation: Verify that all Mule applications across layers are properly instrumented with the Datadog APM Connector.

2. Use consistent naming conventions: Implement a naming strategy for your Mule services that clearly identifies the layer (e.g., 'el-service-name', 'pl-service-name', 'sl-service-name').

3. Implement distributed tracing: Make sure distributed tracing is correctly set up across your Mule services to maintain context across layer boundaries.

4. Check trace sampling: Ensure your trace sampling rate is sufficient to capture inter-layer communications.

5. Use custom tags: Leverage custom tags in your Mule applications to denote the layer each service belongs to.

6. Allow sufficient time: Give the system time to collect and process enough trace data to build a comprehensive dependency map.

7. Use service map filters: In Datadog, use service map filters to focus on specific services or tags related to your Mule layers.

8. Contact Datadog Support: If the above steps don't resolve the issue, reach out to Datadog support for further assistance in configuring the APM to correctly visualize your Mule architecture.

If the Dependency Map still doesn't show the expected layer relationships after implementing these steps, it may indicate a limitation in how Datadog currently visualizes Mule-specific architectures. In this case, consider using alternative Datadog visualizations or custom dashboards to represent your Mule layer relationships.",datadog-mulesoft,"configuration,integration,mulesoft,datadog,troubleshooting",medium

Resolution: The following information clarifies the current DMI product lineup and pricing structure:

1. Product Lineup:
   - The previous DMI infrastructure metrics + APM bundle has been deprecated as of April 2024.
   - There are now two separate products in the Datadog Marketplace:
     a) Datadog Mule Integration for infrastructure metrics (DMI)
     b) Datadog Mule Integration for APM (DMI4APM)

2. Pricing Model:
   - DMI (infrastructure metrics): $35 per vCore per month
   - DMI4APM: $50 per agent per month

3. Typical Setup:
   - DMI: The agent reads the license from MuleSoft to determine the total number of cores.
   - DMI4APM: Customers typically install at least 3 agents:
     * One for non-production environments
     * Two for production environments

4. MuleSoft Licensing:
   - The minimum MuleSoft configuration is typically 2 vCores for production and 4 vCores for Sandbox (non-production).
   - This bundle usually costs around $250K per year.

5. Important Notes:
   - Private offers for only 1 vCore are not standard and should be flagged for review.
   - Any questions about the pricing model should be directed to Larisa Arenas Lopez.

"MuleSoft CloudHub 2.0 Monitoring with Datadog Integration - A Datadog representative is running a POV with a bank in Panama interested in API monitoring.

The bank is using MuleSoft CloudHub 2.0, and there's uncertainty about whether the current Datadog integration supports this version or if there are plans to include it in the short term.

Resolution: As of now, the Datadog MuleSoft integration primarily supports CloudHub 1.0 and on-premises Mule deployments. CloudHub 2.0, being a newer platform, is not yet fully supported by our current integration. However, there are alternative approaches to monitor APIs running on CloudHub 2.0:

1. API Tests: Datadog's Synthetic Monitoring can be used to create API tests that monitor the endpoints exposed by the MuleSoft applications, regardless of the CloudHub version.

2. Custom Metrics: If the MuleSoft applications expose metrics endpoints, you can use Datadog's custom metrics ingestion to collect and monitor these metrics.

3. Log Management: CloudHub 2.0 logs can be forwarded to Datadog for centralized log management and analysis.

4. APM for Mule 4: If the applications are built with Mule 4, you can use Datadog's APM Java agent to instrument the Mule runtime for detailed performance monitoring.

While full native support for CloudHub 2.0 is not available yet, these methods can provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities for APIs running on this platform. For the most up-to-date information on CloudHub 2.0 support, it's recommended to check the latest documentation or contact Datadog support directly.

As for future plans, Datadog is continuously working on expanding and improving its integrations. While we can't provide specific timelines for CloudHub 2.0 support, it's likely to be on the roadmap given the platform's growing adoption.",datadog-mulesoft,"integration,mulesoft,datadog,deployment,performance",low

Load Balancer Configuration for Datadog APM with Mule - A customer is inquiring about the appropriate load balancer configuration for routing traffic between VMs/Agents in a Datadog APM setup with Mule. They also ask about the scenario where a span is created on one agent/VM and finished on another.,"Problem: A customer is inquiring about the appropriate load balancer configuration for routing traffic between VMs/Agents in a Datadog APM setup with Mule. They also ask about the scenario where a span is created on one agent/VM and finished on another.

Resolution: 1. Load Balancer Configuration: For Datadog APM with Mule, it's recommended to use a layer 7 (application layer) load balancer with sticky sessions enabled. This ensures that all requests from a single client session are routed to the same backend server, which is crucial for maintaining trace continuity.

2. Distributed Tracing Scenario: The scenario where a span is created on one agent/VM and finished on another is indeed realistic and is known as distributed tracing. Datadog APM supports this through its distributed tracing feature. To ensure this works correctly:
   - Ensure all agents are properly configured with the same Datadog API key
   - Use Datadog's trace context propagation mechanisms (like HTTP headers) to pass trace and span IDs between services
   - Configure your application to properly propagate these tracing headers

3. Agent Configuration: For optimal performance, especially during high load scenarios like performance testing, adjust the Java heap size in the agent configuration. In the conf.yaml file, increase the Xmx value from the default 50m to a higher value like 1024m (Xmx1024m) to allow the agent to handle more data.

4. Performance Testing Considerations: When conducting performance tests, ensure that the Datadog agent is properly sized and configured to handle the expected load. Monitor the agent's performance and adjust as necessary.

5. Production Launch Preparation: Before launching to production, thoroughly test the APM setup under various load conditions to ensure it can handle the expected traffic without impacting application performance.",datadog-mulesoft,"activation,configuration,mulesoft,datadog,authentication",medium

"Load Balancing Configuration for Datadog APM with MuleSoft - When setting up Datadog APM for MuleSoft applications with multiple agents/VMs, there are questions about the appropriate load balancing configuration and potential issues with distributed tracing across different agents.","Problem: When setting up Datadog APM for MuleSoft applications with multiple agents/VMs, there are questions about the appropriate load balancing configuration and potential issues with distributed tracing across different agents.

Resolution: 1. Use a Network Load Balancer (NLB) for load balancing Datadog APM agents. This is necessary because the Datadog agent uses TCP connections on port 8127, which requires TCP-level load balancing.

2. In the case of distributed tracing where a span is created on one agent/VM and finished on another, this scenario is possible but requires proper configuration. The Datadog APM is designed to handle distributed tracing across multiple agents, so as long as all agents are properly configured and can communicate with each other, the tracing should work correctly.

3. To improve performance and handle higher loads, increase the Java heap size in the Datadog agent configuration. In the conf.yaml file, change the Xmx value from 50m to 1024m (e.g., from Xmx50m to Xmx1024m). This allows the agent to use more memory and potentially handle more traces.

4. When implementing these changes or troubleshooting APM issues, it's recommended to schedule a session with the Datadog plugin support team to ensure proper configuration and resolve any issues quickly, especially before production launches or during performance testing.",datadog-mulesoft,"activation,configuration,integration,mulesoft,datadog",medium
Counting spans from single application connected to Azure VM - The customer wants to know how to count the number of spans that should be sent from a single application connected to their Azure VM.,"Problem: The customer wants to know how to count the number of spans that should be sent from a single application connected to their Azure VM.

Resolution: To count the number of spans that should be sent from a single application:

1. Identify all the instrumented operations in your application. Each instrumented operation will generate at least one span.

2. For each operation, determine if it calls any other instrumented services or databases. Each of these calls will generate additional spans.

3. Look for any custom instrumentation you've added that creates spans.

4. Consider any automatic instrumentation added by the APM library.

5. Add up all the spans from steps 1-4 to get a total expected span count.

6. Monitor the actual span count received in Datadog and compare it to your expected count.

7. If there's a significant discrepancy, investigate potential span drops or instrumentation issues.

Remember that the actual span count may vary based on code paths executed and application load. Focus on consistent patterns rather than exact numbers.

To verify spans are being sent correctly:

1. Enable debug logging in your APM tracer configuration.
2. Check the Datadog agent logs for any errors related to span processing.
3. Use Datadog's trace search and analytics to confirm all expected operations are represented.
4. Consider using Datadog's trace sampling features to capture 100% of traces temporarily for accurate counting.

If spans are still missing after these steps, work with IO Connect Services support to investigate potential issues with the integration or network connectivity between your application, the Datadog agent, and Datadog's intake.",datadog-mulesoft,"activation,configuration,integration,datadog,troubleshooting",high
